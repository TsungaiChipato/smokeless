	<div class="box">
		<p class="text">Find a set of mahjong tiles.<br>
		<br>
		A set consists of 20 tiles. You can find these sets online at a variety of price points, so don't worry, you won't need to shell out a
		lot of money if you don't want to! You should also be able to find them at gaming stores.<br>
		<br>
		Learn the suit tiles first. The game uses 3 suits for the main part of gameplay, which are dot/circles, Chinese characters, and bamboo.
		These function much like suits in a deck of cards. Each suit has 4 identical sets of 9 tiles. There are 108 of these tiles in total.<br>
		<br>
		Use honor tiles like suit tiles. Honor tiles are special tiles. Honor tiles show red and green dragons or the 4 winds. You can use these
		almost like suit tiles in that you can match them to make "melds," 3-of-a-kind or 4-of-a-kind.</p>
